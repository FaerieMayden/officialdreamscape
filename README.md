Dreamscape is a game in the works by producers Rose and Rhianna Baker.
The game started out as a cartoon back in 2015, and later was changed into a video game concept.
In the game, you the player are a Human that when you sleep, goes to the Dreamscape as one of three playable characters.
It starts out fun and games, but the player would soon learn the true reason they were called to this dimension: 
it's under attack by the Nightmare.
It becomes the duty of the player, and his or her two friends, to come together and save the worlds, before good dreams are lost forever.
The game itself is an ambitious one,
made up of a small team of people that are doing it just because they love what they're doing,
and they want to share that passion with others. 

Watch, if you'd like, as we slowly piece this ambitious project together. :)
